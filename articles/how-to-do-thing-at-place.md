# How to do Thing at Place #

## So you want to do thing at place? ##

This is an example article. Like most pages in this content repo, it's purpose is just to see how things are rendered in a hugo template.

## Step 1 ##

Start with going to place. This is an example article, so let's not get too specific.

## Step 2 ##

def python_function():
