## A `_index.md` Page ##

This is an example `_index.md` page in the top level content directory.

Perhaps a table would help here as well.

| Thing        | Value 1       | Value 2|
| ------------ |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Thing 1      | True          | False  |
| Thing 2      | False         | True   |
| Thing 3      | !True; !False | NaN    |
